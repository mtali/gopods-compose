# GoPods

GoPods is a modern podcast application developed entirely in Kotlin, leveraging Jetpack Compose for a fully declarative user interface. This project
represents a comprehensive modernization and complete rewrite of its predecessor, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mtali/bolt).

## Features

- **Kotlin**: A modern, expressive programming language.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A declarative UI toolkit.
- **Media3**: Seamless podcast playback.
- **Material3**: Integration of the latest Material Design components.
- **Room**: An offline-first approach for robust data management.
- **Coroutines**: Simplified concurrency handling.
